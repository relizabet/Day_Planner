# Day Planner

## About the Project

For this assignment we were asked to meet the following criteria:

    GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
    WHEN I open the planner
    THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
    WHEN I scroll down
    THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
    WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
    THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
    WHEN I click into a timeblock
    THEN I can enter an event
    WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
    THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
    WHEN I refresh the page
    THEN the saved events persist

### Notes

My biggest challenge for this assignment was getting the local storage to actually display. The data does persist in local storage but I was unable to retrieve it in a way that it would persist on the page.

### As of 07/28/2020

The most recent commit was posted after the deadline, and is not intended to be graded. With the assistance of my tutor I was able to solve the localStorage persistance problem and wanted to update the code accordingly.
